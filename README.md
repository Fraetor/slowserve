# Slowserve

A very slow HTTP server to see what the web is like at extremes.

## Requirements

Slowserve is a [Python WSGI Server](https://peps.python.org/pep-3333/). I
recommend using [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) to run it, ideally behind a
reverse proxy such as [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) for more permanent
deployments.

## Usage

To run slowserve use the following command.

```sh
# We need lots of threads because each one serves very slowly.
gunicorn --threads 50 slowserve:app
```

Once running any GET requests to the server will be served the `index.html`
file. By default the serving rate is 100 bytes per second. To change the rate at
which the file is served you can add a query string for the serving rate in
bytes per second, e.g: `http://localhost:8000/?rate=300`.
